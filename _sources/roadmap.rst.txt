Roadmap
-------

Several releases are planned in the development roadmap. Backward incompatible
changes, deprecations, and major features are noted for each of these releases.

Releases published follow `semantic versioning`_, and so it is recommended that
dependencies on ``umbrella`` are pinned to a specific version below the next major
version.
